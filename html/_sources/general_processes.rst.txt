------------------
Defining variables
------------------


As a general rules, any ``variable`` referenced in this documentation must be either:

* Defined in the yaml config file that is passed to snakemake by ``--configfile``
* Defined directly in the snakemake command by ``--config variable=$value``


-----------------
Logging functions
-----------------

Archiving processes are defined in the file :file:`workflows/logging.rules`. The variable ``logging_folder`` must be defined in the ``config.yaml`` or passed to snakemake with ``--config``. Each time an effective snakemake run is started, a folder named with the current UTC datetime is created. A variable number of files will be copied there, so that replication of the run is possible:

* The snakefile passed to snakemake
* The config file
* The full command used, copied into the file ``cmd.txt``
* The parameter files defining the SRA and the local samples, if they exist
 
The logs of every command run during the execution of the workflow will then be stored in this folder.
  
------------------------
Determining sample names
------------------------

Sample naming and matching to fastq files are handled in the file :file:`workflows/making_sample_dataset.rules`.


Local samples
-------------

Local samples will be determined based on a tabulated file whose full path must be passed to the variable ``local_samples`` in the ``config.yaml`` or through ``--config`` on the snakemake command. It must contain at least two columns: `SampleName` and `ScientificName`.

.. csv-table:: Local data example
   :header: "SampleName", "ScientificName"
   
   "S10","Staphylococcus aureus"
   "S1","Staphylococcus aureus"


For each entry, there must be in the folder defined by the ``link_directory`` variable, two files (for paired reads) or only one (for single reads) whose filename starts by one and only one entry of the `SampleName` columns. For instance, the files ``S10_001_R1_L001.fastq.gz`` and ``S10_001_R2_L001.fastq.gz`` in the folder defined by the ``link_directory`` variable will be matched to the sample name ``S10``. The matching is performed by using regular expressions to end the search at non alphanumeric characters or by the end of the word, thus the sample name ``S1`` will actually not match ``S10_001_R1_L001.fastq.gz`` nor ``S10_001_R2_L001.fastq.gz``.

If needed, an `OldSampleName` column can be added to the file, when the read filenames and the desired new sample names can not be matched simply by testing the identity at the start of both names. 

.. csv-table:: Local data example with old sample names
   :header: "SampleName", "ScientificName", "OldSampleName"
   
   "S10","Staphylococcus aureus","Staaur-10"
   "S1","Staphylococcus aureus","Staaur-1"	
      
In this case, the files ``Staaur-10_S10_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`` and ``Staaur-10_S10_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz`` in the folder defined in ``link_directory`` will be matched to the sample name ``S10``. Similarly, ``Staaur-1`` will actually not match ``Staaur-10_S10_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz``.

   
SRA samples
-----------

SRA samples will be determined based on the tabulated file whose full path must be passed to the variable ``sra_samples``. The RunInfo files that can be downloaded through the `SRA NCBI <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/>`_ database can be directly passed without any modification. Otherwise, four columns must be defined.

.. csv-table:: SRA data example
   :header: "Run","SampleName", "LibraryLayout", "ScientificName"
	 
   "ERR1140788","Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_N0145-Lineage_2","paired","Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
   "SRR006916","Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_K21-Lineage_1","single","Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
